        <h3><u>
            Non -Academic Life
        </h3></u>
        <p style="font-size: larger;"><i>
            Outside of my academic pursuits, I find immense joy in the world of music, dance, and theater arts.
            When I'm not hitting the books, you'll often find me strumming my guitar, dancing to the beat, belting out a tune, or immersing myself in the world of theatre arts.
            I also love being a part of theater, where I get to step into different roles and tell stories in a unique and exciting way.
            These activities aren't just hobbies; they're my way of adding some color and fun to my life, a break from the serious stuff. They help me discover more about myself and celebrate the joy of creativity!
